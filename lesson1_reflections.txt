How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I will be able to find bugs and changes in my apps very easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will be able to restore my code to any exact point of time i may need.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I am in control of choosing what be saved and what not to be saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    most of the times the project we work on consists of multiple files it is necessary
    to save them all in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commits along with date time and commit messages.
    using git diff i can compare two commits and find what has changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will be able  to make big changes to my code with no worries but before that i need 
    to learn more about git.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I am working on few project i will try to use git for them
